Currently I am working at BMW Group in the Autonomous Driving Division. The views expressed on this blog are personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the Technical University Munich (TUM). My focus
was on Machine Learning and Robotics. After my studies I joined BMW an mainly worked at environment perception. 

 Lately, I fall in love with Deep Reinforcement Learning. This blogs contains my learning journey.
