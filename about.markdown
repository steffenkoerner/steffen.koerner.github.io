Currently I am working at BMW Group in the Autonomous Driving Division. The views expressed on this blog are my personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the Technical University Munich (TUM). My focus
was on Machine Learning and Robotics. Afterwards, I joined BMW and mainly work on environment perception. 

I am fascinated by so many topics in Software Engineering and Mathematics. Thus, this blog will be a random collection of topcis in this area, but in the beginning it will mainly focus on reinforcement learning.

If you want to further discuss about software engineering/mathematics feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn - steffen koerner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffen-k%C3%B6rner-371a2782/)
