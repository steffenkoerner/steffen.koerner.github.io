Currently I am working at BMW Group in the Autonomous Driving Division. The views expressed on this blog are my personal opinions, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer.

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the Technical University Munich (TUM). My focus
was on Machine Learning and Robotics. Afterwards, I joined BMW and mainly worken on environment perception. 

 Lately, I fall in love with Deep Reinforcement Learning and started to do some research in my free time.

 If you want to further discuss about reinforcement learning feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn - steffen koerner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffen-k%C3%B6rner-371a2782/)
